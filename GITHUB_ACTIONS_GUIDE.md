# 🚀 GitHub Actions Guide - Build Mobile App Without Local Tools

This guide shows you how to use GitHub Actions to automatically build your Minoxidil Tracker mobile app for Android and other platforms without installing any development tools locally.

## ✨ What GitHub Actions Does

- **🔄 Automatic Builds**: Every time you push code, it automatically builds
- **📱 Multi-Platform**: Builds for Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS
- **☁️ Cloud-Based**: No local tools needed - everything runs on GitHub's servers
- **📦 Ready-to-Install**: Downloads APK files directly to your phone
- **🆓 Free**: 2000 minutes/month free for public repositories

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" button → "New repository"
3. Name it: `MinoxidilTrackerMobile`
4. Make it **Public** (free GitHub Actions)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code

```bash
# In your project directory
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MinoxidilTrackerMobile.git
git commit -m "Initial commit: Minoxidil Tracker Mobile App"
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Will Automatically Run

Once you push your code, GitHub Actions will:
1. **Detect the push** and start building
2. **Set up build environment** (Android SDK, .NET, etc.)
3. **Build your app** for multiple platforms
4. **Create downloadable files** (APK, etc.)

## 📱 What You Get

### Android Build
- **APK file** ready to install on your phone
- **AAB file** for Google Play Store submission
- **Build logs** showing any errors

### Windows Build
- **Windows executable** for testing
- **All dependencies** included

## 🔍 How to Access Built Apps

### After Build Completes:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Actions" tab**
3. **Click on the latest workflow run**
4. **Scroll down to "Artifacts"**
5. **Download the APK file**

### Install on Android Phone:

1. **Download the APK** from GitHub Actions
2. **Transfer to your phone** (email, USB, cloud)
3. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"** in phone settings
4. **Tap the APK file** to install
5. **Grant permissions** when prompted

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
1. **Check the Actions tab** for error details
2. **Look at build logs** to see what went wrong
3. **Fix the code** and push again
4. **Actions will automatically retry**

### APK Won't Install?
1. **Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"**
2. **Check Android version compatibility**
3. **Verify APK file downloaded completely**

### No Artifacts?
1. **Wait for build to complete** (can take 10-15 minutes)
2. **Check if build succeeded** (green checkmark)
3. **Look for "Artifacts" section** at bottom of run

## 🔄 Workflow Triggers

The build runs automatically when:
- ✅ **Push to main/master branch**
- ✅ **Pull request to main/master**
- ✅ **Manual trigger** (workflow_dispatch)

## 📊 Build Status

You can see build status:
- **🟢 Green**: Build succeeded
- **🔴 Red**: Build failed
- **🟡 Yellow**: Build in progress

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Commit often** - each push triggers a new build
2. **Check Actions tab** after pushing code
3. **Download APKs** before they expire (90 days)
4. **Use public repo** for free Actions minutes
5. **Monitor build times** (usually 10-15 minutes)

## 🎉 What's Next?

After setting up GitHub Actions:

1. **Push your code** to trigger the first build
2. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for build to complete
3. **Download the APK** from Actions tab
4. **Install on your phone** and test the app
5. **Make changes** and push again for new builds
